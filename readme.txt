Header: How at risk is your neighborhood? 

Summary: There is no formal list of URMS in Utah. Instead, agencies look for at risk neiborhoods by identifying the median year of buildings in those areas were built, as well as the material it was built with. Using that criteria officials are able to locate areas of concern by searching county records.
